# Footsteps of a Forest

**Footsteps of a Forest** is a generative art project that visualizes step count data over time, represented through growing trees. Each tree grows as a metaphor for personal movement and activity, where every branch represents a step, and the branching patterns evolve over time based on step count data. The project combines personal data with nature-inspired visualizations, generating trees that "grow" as data is received.

## Features

- **Generative Forest**: Each participant has their own tree that grows based on step count data.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Trees grow and branch out in real-time, reflecting personal activity.
- **Dynamic Colors**: Each person's tree has a unique color to distinguish them.
- **CSV Integration**: Data is loaded from a CSV file containing step count information for each person over time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Start the visualization via a splash screen with a "Start" button, and reset the simulation with a reset button.
- **Background Music**: An audio file plays in the background to accompany the growing forest.
